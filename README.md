#Final project for 6205
In our project, we want to solve a 10-dimension function to find its maximun value. So we need to implement our GA to find the solution.
There are three java files in the project. GA is the algorithm and IndexMaxPQ is the index priority queue sort method of selection part of GA. And there is also an uniTest file.
